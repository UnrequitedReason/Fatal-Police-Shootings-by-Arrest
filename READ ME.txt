What is this?

An analysis of fatal police shootings in the U.S. by race, per arrest rate.



What does it mean?

Results show that comparing fatal shootings to arrest rates instead of population distribution decreases the discrepancy between fatal police shootings by race, although it does not entirely eliminate it.



Why is this important?

It is important to understand the degree of the disparity between races for fatal police shootings in order to better understand why it exists. The results show that a large portion of the discrepancy between races can be explained by arrest rates (especially for Native American populations, who actually have the lowest unarmed death/arrest rate of all races examined. The high ratios for black and hispanic populations, however, remain concerning.
